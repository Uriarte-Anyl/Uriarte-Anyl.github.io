                Swiss Design, or International Typographic Style, originated in
                Switzerland in the 1940s and 1950s. It emphasizes clarity,
                simplicity, and functionality through grid-based layouts,
                sans-serif fonts like Helvetica, and minimal color. Visual
                hierarchy and readability are central, enhanced by white space,
                clean lines, and geometric shapes. This timeless approach
                remains a foundation of modern graphic and web design. Swiss
                Design is widely used in branding, posters, and digital
                interfaces.

                Swiss Design relies on grid systems to create balance and
                structure, ensuring a clean and organized layout. Its minimalist
                color palettes, often black, white, and primary colors,
                emphasize simplicity and functionality. Asymmetry within grids
                adds visual interest while maintaining harmony. The use of
                neutral, timeless fonts like Helvetica supports its modern,
                universal appeal. This adaptability keeps Swiss Design
                influential across branding, editorial, and digital media.

                Swiss Design, also known as International Typographic Style,
                originated in Switzerland in the 1940s and 1950s. It emerged as
                designers sought a clean, functional, and universal approach to
                visual communication. Influenced by movements like Bauhaus and
                De Stijl, it emphasized clarity, order, and readability. The use
                of grids, sans-serif fonts, and minimal color became its
                defining traits. This innovative style revolutionized graphic
                design, making it a global standard for modernist aesthetics.
